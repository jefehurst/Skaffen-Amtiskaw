description: Update notes, commit, and push current work
---

Checkpoint the current session. This is a save point for work in progress.

1. **Update documentation** as needed:

   - TODO.md: Update task status, add new discoveries, clear completed items
   - CLAUDE.md: Add any new conventions, paths, or knowledge learned this session
   - Other relevant docs (INDEX.md files, etc.)

2. **Review staged changes**:

   - Run `git status` and `git diff` to see what's changed
   - Ensure no secrets or credentials are staged

3. **Commit with descriptive message**:

   - Summarize what was accomplished
   - Note any work in progress

4. **Push to remote**

If there are no meaningful changes to commit, say so and skip the commit.
