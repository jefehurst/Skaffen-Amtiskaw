When using repo-local tools (justfile recipes, vendor CLIs, lsq commands):

1. BEFORE using any just recipe: run `just --list` to identify the correct recipe name, then `just agenthelp <recipe>` to get usage instructions.

2. If a local tool fails: FIX THE TOOL. Do not assume it's broken and seek alternatives. These tools were built for this environment and any failures indicate bugs to be corrected.

3. After resolving issues with a recipe: update help/<recipe>.md and help/<recipe>-compressed.md with lessons learned to prevent future errors.
