1. **Update TODO.md** with a new "Plan: [Feature]" section
2. **Conduct premortem analysis**:
   - Edge cases and failure modes
   - Security considerations
   - Testing strategy
   - Code reuse opportunities
3. **Break into tasks** with priorities (P0/P1/P2)
4. **List open questions** that need clarification
5. **Document key decisions** with rationale
