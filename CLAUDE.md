# Claude Code Instructions

## First Thing Every Session
Read these memory files before doing anything else:
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-geoffhurst/memory/MEMORY.md` (active projects, environment notes)
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-geoffhurst/memory/ellucian-upgrades.md` (detailed project state)

These files contain session state, known workarounds, and progress — do NOT repeat discovery work that's already documented there.

## After Completing Work
Update the memory files with any new findings, workarounds, or progress changes.
